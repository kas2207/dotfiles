Magit v2.7.0 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Changes since v2.6.2
--------------------

* Added new popup `magit-subtree-popup' and bound "O" to it.

* Added new commands `magit-worktree-checkout',
  `magit-worktree-branch', `magit-worktree-delete',
  and `magit-worktree-status'.

* Added new section inserter `magit-insert-worktrees'

* The command `magit-stage' learned to stage an untracked file while
  leaving its content unstaged (i.e. `git add --intent-to-add') when
  called with a prefix argument.

* The command `magit-rebase--continue' learned to reuse the old commit
  message as-is when called with a prefix argument.

* In the refs buffer symbolic refs, such as "remotes/origin/HEAD", are
  no longer omitted from the lists of local and remote branches.
